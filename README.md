About Me:
Hello, I am looking forward to learning as much as possible about software development and engineering. I have a M.S. in Business, and I would like to combine my knowledge of business/accounting/finance and sales with technology. In turn, would like to work on ground-breaking research and develop prototypes and process that help people and our environment.
